<h3>Taeyeon - Rain</h3>

<pre>Empty grey streets feel too bare
I open the glass window out of melancholy
Fallen raindrops atop my two palms
Filling full with loneliness it spills into my heart
Tonight I miss you for some reason
Tears are welling up
Reminiscing you in my heart

Memories come down when it rains, spreading pain
Watching you as you get soaked
Clear in that moment,
wet with memories
I think of you when you were beautiful in the rain

Will even the long season bright with snow
Fade away inside the photo album

This night is growing ever deeper
Unforgotten promises
Your warm embrace, goodbye

Memories come down when it rains, spreading pain
Watching you as you get soaked
Clear in that moment,
wet with memories
I think of you when you were beautiful in the rain

You were my ray of light
in a black and white world
(Rain) be the rain come to me
and shine my soul

Doo-doo-doo-

Quiet whispers under the umbrella Woo-
It spread in the corner of my heart I can hear you
Raindrops are comforting as
if they ask me about my day
Memories that faded within the rain that’s you

Woo, rain, Woo… Dreaming in the rain

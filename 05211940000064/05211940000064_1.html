<pre class="serif">Someone's breath. That heavy breath
How can I see through that?
Though I can't understand your breath
It's alright I'll hold you
You really did a good job
-Breath by Lee Hi
</pre>

<pre class="sansserif">I refuse to be compared, I’m telling you the truth
If we’re talking about my value, I’m a billion dollar baby
People who know a thing or two, they all know it so ask them
Grab anyone and ask them who is the best
-I Am The Best by 2NE1
</pre>

<pre class="monospace">Under the orange sun
We’re dancing without a shadow
There’s no decided goodbye
Let’s meet in the beautiful memories
Forever young
-Eight by IU
